<h1 id="codeigniter-4-framework">CodeIgniter 4 Framework</h1>
<h2 id="what-is-codeigniter">What is CodeIgniter?</h2>
<p>CodeIgniter is a PHP full-stack web framework that is light, fast, flexible, and secure. 
More information can be found at the <a href="http://codeigniter.com">official site</a>.</p>
<p>This repository holds the distributable version of the framework,
including the user guide. It has been built from the 
<a href="https://github.com/codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4">development repository</a>.</p>
<p>More information about the plans for version 4 can be found in <a href="http://forum.codeigniter.com/thread-62615.html">the announcement</a> on the forums.</p>
<p>The user guide corresponding to this version of the framework can be found
<a href="https://codeigniter4.github.io/userguide/">here</a>. </p>
<h2 id="important-change-with-indexphp">Important Change with index.php</h2>
<p><code>index.php</code> is no longer in the root of the project! It has been moved inside the <em>public</em> folder,
for better security and separation of components.</p>
<p>This means that you should configure your web server to "point" to your project's <em>public</em> folder, and
not to the project root. A better practice would be to configure a virtual host to point there. A poor practice would be to point your web server to the project root and expect to enter <em>public/...</em>, as the rest of your logic and the
framework are exposed.</p>
<p><strong>Please</strong> read the user guide for a better explanation of how CI4 works!
The user guide updating and deployment is a bit awkward at the moment, but we are working on it!</p>
